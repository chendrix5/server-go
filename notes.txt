In this code, the http.HandleFunc function sets up a route for the root path /, and the function passed as the second argument is called when a request is made to that path. In this case, the function simply writes the string "Hello, World!" to the response writer.

The http.ListenAndServe function starts the server and listens for incoming requests on port 8080. When a request is received, the server calls the appropriate handler function based on the path specified in the request.
